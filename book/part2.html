    <h1>Tools and Techniques</h1>

    <p>Part II builds on the basics by demonstrating more advanced
    tools and techniques that are useful for building real world
    programs. Here you'll learn about useful libraries for building
    practical applications, as well as design patterns that help
    combine different features of the language to good effect.</p>

    <p>This part begins by introducing two of the most common
    datastructures used in OCaml: maps and hashtables. We then
    change gears and explain how to build expressive command-line
    interfaces, which is a good example of a sophisticated use of
    the type system to create a user friendly library.</p>

    <p>Some of the examples in this part use the JSON interchange
    format, and so we first show how to use third-party tools to
    parse and generate JSON, as well as how to build a parser from
    scratch. Another interchange format used throughout OCaml are
    s-expressions, and this chapter shows how to turn any OCaml
    value into an s-expression by using the powerful PPX syntax
    preprocessor.</p>

    <p>We close with a tour of the Async communications library,
    which lets you build scalable, high-performance networked
    applications in OCaml. By the end of the chapter, you will be
    able to run web queries against the DuckDuckGo engine by using
    Async, JSON and a HTTP library all written in OCaml.</p>
